                                            <p class="lead">My name is Bradley Haveman, I am a front-end developer from Ontario Canada. I saw this job posting on Adam’s Twitter, and I got excited because it's just up my ally. I appreciated the way it was written and wish more companies wrote job descriptions like this. I found it very honest and legit.</p>
                                            <p class="lead"><br></p>
                                            <p class="lead">A little bit about my experiences. For the past five years, I have been developing websites using the HubSpot CMS, primarily with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I worked as an in-house developer for <a target="_blank" class="text-white" href="https://www.thebritagency.com/" >The Brit Agency</a> for a little over 3 years, and currently working as an front-end developer for <a target="_blank" class="text-white" href="https://www.lean-labs.com/" >Lean Labs</a> for about two years now. We are a fully remote team with people from around the world, and they are a great company to work for. Currently, I am developing on the HubSpot CMS, using Bootstrap along with custom CSS and Javascript to build out websites.</p>
                                            <p class="lead"><br></p>
                                            <p class="lead">My experience with React and Vue are limited, I did a Udmey course on React and have built a couple (tiny) applications. I have a general understanding of the concept and how React and Vue work, but I have never used React or Vue professionally. Same goes for Alpine.js, Next.js, Laravel and MDX, I’ve heard of them, seen some code here and there, but never actually used them in a real environment. I do believe that I am a very fast learner and that I would be able to get to speed with these languages very quickly. Especially since I have a lot of experience using Javascript. I am very excited and have been looking for an opportunity to dive deeper with these languages.</p>
                                            <p class="lead"><br></p>
                                            <p class="lead">I think we are a great fit for each other because I have a strong understanding of CSS and Javascript. As well as having experience working effectively from home both independently and collaboratively. I believe that my "go-getter" attitude and problem-solving skills will be a great asset to your team. I have done some pair programming with other devs and have really enjoyed it, I find it very useful for solving hard problems.  I love the tech industry and everything that comes with it. I love learning new things and seeing what other developers are building.</p>

                                            <p class="lead">Thanks for taking the time to read my application, I also recorded a quick video for you. </p>
